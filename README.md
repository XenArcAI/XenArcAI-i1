## üåü Overview

**Xenith** is a cutting-edge transformer model engineered by the team at xAI for unparalleled performance in text classification and beyond. Combining a robust Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, efficient attention mechanisms, and specialized support for large contexts and multilingual capabilities (like Hinglish), Xenith is optimized for TPUs and designed to push the boundaries of modern AI.

### Key Features
- **Large Context Handling**: Supports sequences up to 32,768 tokens with advanced chunking and summarization.
- **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**: Dynamically routes tokens to 64 experts, activating 8 per token for efficiency and power.
- **Efficient Attention**: Sparse and full attention options, with dynamic window sizing for optimal performance.
- **Hinglish Support**: Seamlessly processes mixed Hindi-English text with a combined tokenizer.
- **TPU Optimization**: Ready for PyTorch XLA, ensuring lightning-fast training and inference.
- **LoRA Adaptation**: Low-Rank Adaptation for efficient fine-tuning across attention and feed-forward layers.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch (with optional XLA support for TPUs)
- Hugging Face Transformers (`pip install transformers`)
- Optional: IndicNLP for Hindi support (`pip install git+https://github.com/anoopkunchukuttan/indic_nlp_library.git`)
- Optional: Safetensors for optimized model saving (`pip install safetensors`)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xAI/xenith.git
   cd xenith
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. (Optional) Set up TPU environment with PyTorch XLA:
   ```bash
   pip install torch-xla
   ```

### Quick Usage
```python
from xenith import Xenith, ModelArgs

# Initialize with default config
args = ModelArgs()
model = Xenith(args)

# Example input (token IDs)
import torch
input_ids = torch.randint(1, args.vocab_size, (1, 128)).to(model.device)

# Forward pass
model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    logits, _, _, _, _, _ = model(input_ids)
print(logits.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([1, 128, vocab_size])
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture Highlights

Xenith is a beast of engineering, blending innovative components into a cohesive powerhouse. Here's a peek under the hood:

### Core Components
- **Token Embedding**: Parallel embeddings with a dynamically sized vocabulary.
- **Transformer Blocks**: 80 layers (configurable), with a mix of dense MLPs and MoE layers.
- **Attention Mechanisms**:
  - Full attention for initial layers.
  - Sparse attention with dynamic window sizing for efficiency in later layers.
  - Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) with YaRN scaling for long contexts.
- **Normalization**: Choice of RMSNorm or LayerNorm for stability.
- **Output Layer**: LoRA-adapted projection to vocabulary size.

### Mixture of Experts (MoE)
- **Experts**: 64 specialized MLPs, with 8 activated per token.
- **Router**: Dynamic, learnable gating with balance and entropy regularization.
- **Shared Expert**: Optional shared MLP alongside routed experts.

### Long Context Management
- **Chunking**: Breaks inputs into 4096-token chunks.
- **Summarizer**: Transformer-based summarization producing 128 summary vectors per chunk.
- **Memory Bank**: Dynamic LRU cache storing up to 200 chunk summaries for context retrieval.

## üé® Configuration

Customize Xenith with the `ModelArgs` dataclass. Here‚Äôs a snippet of key parameters:

```python
@dataclass
class ModelArgs:
    dim: int = 8192                # Model dimension
    n_layers: int = 80             # Number of transformer layers
    n_heads: int = 64              # Query heads
    n_kv_heads: int = 16           # Key/Value heads (GQA)
    max_seq_len: int = 32768       # Maximum sequence length
    moe: bool = True               # Enable MoE
    n_routed_experts: int = 64     # Total experts
    n_activated_experts: int = 8   # Experts per token
    use_lora: bool = True          # Enable LoRA
    q_lora_rank: int = 256         # LoRA rank for queries
    # ... (and many more!)
```

See the full `ModelArgs` definition in `xenith.py` for all options.

## üìä Performance

Xenith is designed for scale and speed:
- **Parameter Count**: Billions of total parameters, with active parameters optimized via MoE.
- **Throughput**: TPU-optimized for massive datasets.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Gradient checkpointing and sparse attention reduce footprint.

*Benchmarks coming soon!*

## üåê Multilingual Capabilities

Xenith shines with Hinglish and beyond:
- **Tokenizer**: Combines XLM-RoBERTa-large with Hindi tokens (via IndicNLP) and custom tags (`<HIN>`, `<ENG>`, etc.).
- **Language Adapters**: Optional per-layer adapters for Hindi and mixed-language inputs.

---

## üíæ Saving & Loading

### Save Model
```python
model.save_pretrained("./xenith_model", safe_serialization=True)
```

### Load Model
```python
loaded_model = Xenith.from_pretrained("./xenith_model")
```

Supports both `safetensors` (recommended) and PyTorch‚Äôs `torch.save` formats.

## üß™ Testing

Run the built-in test suite:
```bash
python xenith.py
```
This validates instantiation, forward passes (train/inference), and save/load functionality.
